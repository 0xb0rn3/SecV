## üèóÔ∏è Understanding the Architecture

### Module Structure and Components
SecV modules follow a standardized structure that promotes consistency while allowing flexibility in implementation approaches. Understanding this structure is crucial for both using existing modules and creating new ones.

Each SecV module consists of three essential components that work together to provide a complete security capability:

**Module Configuration (module.json)** serves as the central definition file that describes the module's capabilities, requirements, and interface specifications. This JSON file contains metadata such as the module name, version, category, and author information. More importantly, it defines the input parameters the module expects, the output data it produces, and execution parameters like timeout values and concurrency settings.

**Executable Implementation** represents the actual security tool or script that performs the desired functionality. This can be implemented in any programming language or as any executable format, providing maximum flexibility for developers to use the most appropriate technology for their specific security task.

**Documentation (README.md)** provides comprehensive information about the module's purpose, usage instructions, input and output specifications, and practical examples. This documentation is essential for users to understand how to effectively utilize the module within their security workflows.

### Execution Flow and Lifecycle
The SecV engine manages the complete execution lifecycle of security modules through a well-defined process that ensures consistent behavior and reliable results.

**Module Discovery Phase** begins when SecV scans the `tools/` directory recursively, looking for valid module configurations. During this phase, the engine builds an inventory of available modules and their capabilities.

**Validation Phase** follows discovery, where SecV verifies that each module's configuration is valid and that the specified executables are accessible on the current system. This validation helps prevent runtime errors and provides early feedback about module availability.

**Context Preparation Phase** occurs when a module is selected for execution. SecV serializes the execution context, including target information, parameters, and any results from previous modules, into a standardized JSON format that is passed to the module via standard input.

**Execution Phase** launches the module executable with appropriate timeout controls and error handling mechanisms. The engine monitors the execution progress and manages system resources to ensure stable operation.

**Result Processing Phase** handles the module's output, parsing and validating the returned JSON data to ensure it conforms to the expected format. This phase also calculates execution metrics and timestamps.

**Reporting Phase** presents the results to the user in a human-readable format while maintaining the structured data for potential use in workflows or further processing.

### Workflow Engine Capabilities
For complex security assessments that require multiple coordinated steps, SecV provides a sophisticated workflow engine that can orchestrate intricate multi-stage operations.

**Sequential Execution** enables you to define a specific order for module execution, ensuring that prerequisites are met before dependent modules run. This is particularly useful for security assessments that build upon previous results.

**Conditional Logic** allows workflows to make decisions based on the results of previous modules. For example, a vulnerability scanner might only run if a port scanner first identifies open services.

**Error Handling Strategies** provide flexibility in how workflows respond to module failures. You can configure workflows to continue despite errors, stop immediately on failure, or retry failed operations with different parameters.

**Data Flow Management** automatically passes results between modules, enabling sophisticated assessments where later modules can use information gathered by earlier ones.

**Parallel Processing** supports executing independent modules concurrently, dramatically reducing the time required for comprehensive security assessments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Examples and Patterns

### Basic Module Execution
Understanding how to execute individual modules is fundamental to using SecV effectively. The platform provides several approaches to module execution, each suited to different use cases.

```bash
# Execute a simple network module against a target
go run secv.go execute spoof --target eth0 --params '{"interface": "eth0", "new_mac": "random"}'

# Run a port scanner with custom parameters
go run secv.go execute port-scanner --target 192.168.1.1 --params '{"ports": "1-1000", "timeout": 60}'

# Execute a web application scanner with detailed configuration
go run secv.go execute web-scanner --target https://example.com --params '{"depth": 3, "timeout": 30, "aggressive": false}'
```

### Interactive Mode Usage
The interactive mode provides an excellent way to explore available modules and execute them with guided parameter input. This mode is particularly useful for learning about new modules or performing ad-hoc security testing.

```bash
# Launch SecV in interactive mode
go run secv.go interactive
```

When you start interactive mode, SecV presents a menu-driven interface that guides you through the process of selecting modules, configuring parameters, and reviewing results. The interactive mode includes features such as module selection from available options, guided parameter input with validation, real-time result display with formatting, and access to module information and documentation.

### Workflow Execution Examples
Workflows represent the true power of SecV, enabling complex multi-stage security assessments that adapt based on intermediate results.

```bash
# Execute a comprehensive network assessment workflow
go run secv.go workflow workflows/network-assessment.json --target 192.168.1.0/24

# Run a web application security assessment with custom parameters
go run secv.go workflow workflows/web-assessment.json --target https://example.com --params '{"aggressive": true, "depth": 5}'

# Execute a targeted penetration testing workflow
go run secv.go workflow workflows/pentest-workflow.json --target 10.0.0.0/16 --params '{"stealth": true}'
```

### Module Management Operations
SecV provides comprehensive tools for managing and inspecting available modules, helping you understand what capabilities are available and how to use them effectively.

```bash
# List all available modules with categorization
go run secv.go list

# Get detailed information about a specific module
go run secv.go info spoof

# List modules in a specific category
go run secv.go list --category network
```

## üìù Creating Security Modules

### Understanding Module Structure
Creating effective SecV modules requires understanding the platform's conventions and best practices. The module structure is designed to be both flexible and standardized, allowing for creativity while ensuring consistency.

### Module Configuration Deep Dive
The `module.json` file serves as the contract between your module and the SecV engine. Let's examine a comprehensive example using the MAC address spoofer module:

```json
{
  "name": "spoof",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "category": "Network",
  "description": "A cross-platform MAC address spoofer using system-native scripting.",
  "author": "0xbv1",
  "executablesByOS": {
    "windows": "powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\\macspoof.ps1",
    "linux": "./macspoof.sh",
    "darwin": "./macspoof.sh"
  },
  "dependencies": [],
  "inputs": {
    "interface": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The network interface to modify.",
      "required": true
    },
    "new_mac": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The new MAC address to set. Use 'random' for a random MAC.",
      "required": true
    }
  },
  "outputs": {
    "original_mac": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The original MAC address of the interface."
    },
    "new_mac": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The new MAC address set on the interface."
    },
    "status": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The final status of the spoofing operation."
    }
  },
  "timeout": 120,
  "concurrent": false
}
```

This configuration demonstrates several important concepts. The **executablesByOS** field enables cross-platform compatibility by specifying different commands for different operating systems. This is particularly important for security tools that often need to interact with system-level functionality that varies between platforms.

The **inputs** section defines the parameters your module expects, including data types, descriptions, and whether they are required. This information is used by SecV to validate input and provide helpful error messages to users.

The **outputs** section describes the data your module will return, helping users understand what information they can expect and how they might use it in workflows.

### Cross-Platform Implementation Strategy
When creating modules that work across different operating systems, consider the unique characteristics and capabilities of each platform. The MAC address spoofer example demonstrates this principle by using PowerShell on Windows and shell scripts on Unix-like systems.

For Windows implementations, PowerShell provides powerful system administration capabilities and .NET framework access. Windows modules can leverage WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) for system information gathering and COM objects for interacting with applications.

For Linux implementations, shell scripts provide direct access to system utilities and configuration files. Linux modules can use tools like `ip`, `ifconfig`, and direct manipulation of `/sys` or `/proc` filesystems.

For macOS implementations, while similar to Linux in many ways, macOS has specific tools and behaviors that may require different approaches. The `networksetup` command-line tool, for example, is specific to macOS for network configuration.

### Input and Output Handling
SecV modules receive their execution context through standard input as a JSON object. This context includes the target information, parameters, and any results from previous modules in a workflow. Your module should parse this JSON input and extract the necessary information to perform its function.

The output from your module should be a JSON object that conforms to the SecV result format. This includes success indicators, data payloads, error messages, and execution metadata. Consistent output formatting ensures that your modules can be effectively used in workflows and that users receive predictable results.

### Error Handling and Reliability
Security modules often interact with system resources, network services, and external tools that can fail in various ways. Implementing robust error handling is crucial for creating reliable modules that provide useful feedback when things go wrong.

Consider implementing timeout handling for operations that might hang, validation of input parameters before attempting operations, graceful handling of permission errors, and clear error messages that help users understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

### Testing and Validation
Before deploying your modules, thorough testing across different scenarios and platforms ensures reliability and user satisfaction. Test your modules with various input combinations, on different operating systems if applicable, under error conditions to verify graceful failure handling, and with realistic data that represents actual use cases.

### Documentation Best Practices
Comprehensive documentation is essential for module adoption and effective use. Your module's README.md should include a clear description of the module's purpose and capabilities, detailed explanations of all input parameters and their effects, examples of typical usage scenarios, information about any prerequisites or dependencies, and troubleshooting guidance for common issues.

## üîß Advanced Configuration and Customization

### Workflow Definition and Management
Creating effective workflows requires understanding how to structure multi-step operations and handle the complexities of coordinating multiple security modules. Workflows are defined in JSON format and can include conditional logic, error handling strategies, and parallel execution paths.

### Performance Optimization
For large-scale security assessments, optimizing performance becomes crucial. SecV provides several mechanisms for improving execution speed, including concurrent module execution, timeout management, and resource pooling.

### Integration with External Systems
SecV modules can be designed to integrate with external security tools, databases, and reporting systems. This integration capability extends the platform's usefulness in existing security operations centers and automated response systems.

### Security Considerations
When creating security modules, consider the security implications of your implementations. Modules should follow the principle of least privilege, validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks, and handle sensitive information appropriately.
