## 🔧 What is SecV?

SecV (SecVulnHub) is a curated collection of practical cybersecurity utilities and tools built by our core team and vetted community contributors. Think of it as a specialized toolbox where each utility serves a specific purpose in cybersecurity workflows - from reconnaissance and vulnerability assessment to incident response and forensics.

**Our Mission**: Provide reliable, well-documented cybersecurity utilities that practitioners can trust and deploy in real-world scenarios.

**Repository Focus**: Quality over quantity - every tool is tested, documented, and serves a clear purpose in cybersecurity operations.

## 🚀 Core Team Development Cycle

**Current Challenge**: 100 Days of Tool Development  
**Start Date**: June 10, 2025 - 12:45 EAT  
**Commitment**: 20 new utilities every 5 days  
**Team Goal**: Build a comprehensive cybersecurity toolkit

Our core team (SecVulnHub group) follows this development rhythm, but the repository welcomes quality contributions from the broader community at any time.

## 📋 Tool Categories

**Reconnaissance Tools**: Information gathering utilities for target enumeration, subdomain discovery, port scanning, and OSINT collection.

**Vulnerability Assessment**: Automated scanners, configuration auditors, and specialized testing tools for identifying security weaknesses.

**Exploitation Utilities**: Proof-of-concept tools and exploitation frameworks for authorized penetration testing (educational and authorized use only).

**Forensics and Analysis**: Tools for digital investigation, malware analysis, log parsing, and incident reconstruction.

**Automation and Orchestration**: Scripts and frameworks that combine multiple security operations or automate repetitive tasks.

**Defensive Tools**: Monitoring utilities, intrusion detection helpers, and security hardening scripts.

## 🤝 External Contribution Guidelines

If you want to contribute a tool to SecV, here's exactly how to structure your submission so our team can properly evaluate and test it.

### Tool Submission Structure

Every tool submission must follow this precise structure to be considered for inclusion:

**Root Directory Naming**: Use descriptive, hyphenated names like `web-parameter-fuzzer` or `dns-enumeration-tool`. Avoid generic names like `scanner` or `tool`.

**Required Files in Your Tool Directory**:

Your tool directory must contain these specific files for us to properly evaluate your contribution:

**README.md** - This is your tool's main documentation and must include these exact sections:

```markdown
# Tool Name

## Purpose Statement
One clear sentence explaining what specific problem this tool solves.

## Key Features
List 3-5 core capabilities that differentiate this tool from existing alternatives.

## Installation Requirements
- Operating system compatibility
- Required dependencies with version numbers
- Installation commands that actually work

## Usage Examples
At least 3 real-world usage scenarios with actual command syntax and expected outputs.

## Testing Instructions
Step-by-step process for us to verify your tool works as advertised, including test targets or datasets if needed.

## Security Considerations
Any warnings about proper usage, legal considerations, or potential misuse scenarios.

## Author and License
Your contact information and chosen license.
```

**install.sh** - An automated installation script that handles all dependencies and setup. This script must work on a fresh Ubuntu system and should include error handling for common failure scenarios.

**test.sh** - A validation script that demonstrates your tool's core functionality. This helps our team quickly verify that your tool works as intended without having to figure out complex usage scenarios.

**src/** directory containing your actual tool code with meaningful comments explaining the logic, especially for complex security operations.

### What Makes a Tool Acceptable

Understanding our acceptance criteria will help you structure contributions that align with SecV's standards:

**Practical Value**: Your tool should solve a real problem that cybersecurity practitioners encounter. We're not interested in proof-of-concept code or academic exercises - we want utilities that people will actually use in their workflow.

**Code Quality**: Your implementation should demonstrate solid programming practices. This means proper error handling, input validation, clear variable names, and comments explaining complex logic. Remember, other practitioners need to understand and potentially modify your code.

**Documentation Completeness**: If we can't figure out how to use your tool within five minutes of reading your README, it won't be accepted. Your documentation should assume the reader is skilled in cybersecurity but unfamiliar with your specific tool.

**Testing Reliability**: Your tool should work consistently across different environments. Include your test.sh script so we can verify functionality quickly, and make sure your installation process handles edge cases gracefully.

### Submission Process for External Contributors

Here's the step-by-step process for submitting your tool to SecV:

**Step 1: Fork and Prepare** - Fork our repository and create a new branch named after your tool. Clone your fork locally and set up the proper directory structure under the appropriate category in tools/.

**Step 2: Package Your Tool** - Follow the structure requirements exactly. Pay special attention to your README.md, install.sh, and test.sh files since these are what we'll use for initial evaluation.

**Step 3: Test Your Package** - Before submitting, test your entire package on a clean system. Run your install.sh script, then your test.sh script, and make sure everything works exactly as documented.

**Step 4: Submit Pull Request** - Create a pull request with a clear title like "Add [tool-name] for [category]" and include a brief description of what your tool does and why it's valuable for SecV.

**Step 5: Respond to Review** - Our team will test your tool and may request changes or clarifications. Be prepared to iterate on feedback and answer questions about implementation choices.

### Our Review and Testing Process

When you submit a tool, here's what happens on our end so you understand our evaluation criteria:

**Initial Review**: We check if your submission follows the required structure and includes all necessary documentation. Incomplete submissions are rejected immediately with feedback on what's missing.

**Functionality Testing**: We run your install.sh script on a clean test environment, then execute your test.sh validation. If either fails, we'll provide specific error details for you to address.

**Code Audit**: Our team reviews your source code for security best practices, code quality, and potential issues. We're particularly careful about tools that could be misused or contain security vulnerabilities.

**Integration Testing**: We verify that your tool integrates well with SecV's overall structure and doesn't conflict with existing utilities.

**Final Decision**: Accepted tools are merged into the main repository with acknowledgment. Rejected tools receive detailed feedback explaining our decision and suggestions for improvement.

## 🔒 Security and Legal Guidelines

**Ethical Use Only**: All tools in SecV are intended for legitimate cybersecurity purposes including authorized penetration testing, security research, and defensive operations. Contributors and users are responsible for ensuring legal compliance.

**No Malicious Code**: We do not accept tools designed primarily for malicious purposes or that lack legitimate defensive applications. When in doubt, clearly document the legitimate use cases for your tool.

**Responsible Disclosure**: If your tool identifies vulnerabilities, follow responsible disclosure practices and include guidance for users on proper vulnerability reporting.

## 📞 Contact and Community

**Core Team Questions**: For questions about contribution standards or tool evaluation, create an issue with the "contribution-question" label.

**Tool Requests**: If you need a specific utility but can't build it yourself, create an issue with the "tool-request" label and our community might pick it up.

**Bug Reports**: For issues with existing tools, contact the tool's original author (listed in each tool's README) or create an issue if the author is unresponsive.

## ⚖️ Legal Notice

SecV provides cybersecurity utilities for educational and authorized professional use. Users assume full responsibility for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Always obtain proper authorization before using any security testing tools.
